*The following report details two sessions that took place on 4/11/21 and 4/18/21.*

David Adams and Craig Boone are holed up in their favorite (only) bar, Whisper, run by the enigmatic Jorge. They are drinking beer and weighing options. Should they get out of the bounty-hunting business? Go after their last employer before they end up at the wrong end of a bounty themselves?

Suddenly the quiet, neon-tinged air is interrupted by a pair of heavy-set bruisers. They sit on either side of our heroes. A muscle sandwich. The goons order scotch, and breathe.

"Our boss wants to talk with you." One of them says it. Or both. It doesn't matter. 

Not ones to protest in the face of large muscles hiding equally large guns beneath heavy coats, Adams and Boone allow themselves to be escorted to who knows where. But instead of a dark back alley perfect for a corpse or two, the bruisers lead them through a busy metro station, through a passcode-locked door down an inconspicuous flight of stairs, and onto a private tram platform. Whoever is pulling *these* strings, they're a force to reckon with.

Answers are revealed shortly. The tram takes them out of the cramped streets of Dockside to the green hills and blue lakes of Palladium Heights, the station's tightly-secured playground for the wealthy and connected. A false sun climbs across district's simulation sky as the tram pulls into the highest tower in sight.

Up and up the lift climbs. Such suspense. 

Adams and Boone are lead to a surprisingly unassuming door at the end of a long hallway. Walking in, they're greeted by a small man in a big suit, a datapad in one hand and an e-cigar in the other. A deep-cobalt suit and crimson vest speak of extravagant taste with wealth to match. 

"Ah-ha! You've arrived! Please, please." He motions with the cigar. "Tannenbaum. Rufus Tannenbaum. At your service. Though, really, it's you who'll be at mine."

As they make their acquaintance, he is insistent on mentioning his fine decor. This desk, built from the redwoods of Planet Ontario (now extinct). This chair, made from genuine gerbillani leather (now, also, extinct). 

But, eventually, Tannenbaum gets to the point. He works for Blackwell Brokerage, operators of Gateway Station and a number of other holdings scattered throughout the Rim. They are involved with every business imaginable, but they pride themselves on two things specifically: salvage, and information. 

Adams and Boone have caused quite a commotion on the station as of late, Tannenbaum explains, namely damage to Brokerage property and wanton murder. But Lady Blackwell is never one to turn a blindeye to opportunity, and the Brokerage could use a pair of Lancers. Even moreso if those Lancers are in dire straits, with no friends and more enemies by the day. No matter the terms of the contract, it's surely better than the alternatives, no?

So, a deal is made. Our heroes get a low-profile, steady pay, and easy access to manufacturer licenses, at the expense of being Brokerage lap-dogs.

They're shown to their new apartments in one of the less smog-choked corners of Dockside. Adams sets about fashioning a lathe, to occupy his machinist's mind in-between deployments. Boone puts up an image of the mythic hero "Hawkeye," he who was foretold by the prophetic verses of the Avengers Cycle. 

***

Not long after, they receive their first mission from Tannenbaum. Smith-Shimano is after a missing personnel from one of their labs in the rim, a doctor by the name of Amoretta Pisces. The corprostate has reason to believe she passed through Gateway before disappearing, and wants the Brokerage to look into it. Well, you don't say no to Smith-Shimano.
