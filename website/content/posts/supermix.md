YouTube makes a very interesting SuperMix for me. It's greatly improved over the years - before it was just "Mr Blue Sky" over and over again. 
Here is a list in random order of some of the artists YouTube puts in my supermix, and where I rate them.  



### Weezer  
Honestly, My Name is Jonas slaps. However, Cuomo is the name of that governor I hate, and Rivers has more commits on GitHub than I do.
#### B Tier

### Good Charolette  
Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous isn't enough to carry them.
#### C Tier

### 100 Gecs  
Despite being perhaps a quite frankly ludicrous number of gecs, they're about as good as it gets.
#### S Tier

### Veruca Salt  
Nearly every time YouTube has introduced me to a band, it has been a disaster. Not here.
#### A Tier

### Taylor Swift  
Folklore and Evermore good, Midnights mostly good, whatever the new one is called meh.
#### B Tier

### Chappel Roan  
#### S Tier
Obviously.

### U2  
Free music on an ipod?
#### D Tier

### Foo Fighters  
My favorite band. 
#### F Tier
Shouldn't have had an affair baby, sorry.

### Sleep Theory  
Pretty sure they were recommended solely because they sound like Sleep Token.
#### ? Tier

### Hole  
Another rare YouTube W.
#### B Tier
But like, a high B.

### girl in red  
girls
#### A tier  

### Twenty One Pilots  
My favorite band - an emo band that romanticizes living in Ohio.
#### S Tier
But Ohio bad.

### Hoobstank  
I once encountered someone named She Hooben on my Stank while playing rocket league, for some _reason_.
#### C Tier

### Green Day  
I quite like this bad.
#### D Tier
I just wish I liked their music.

### Sabrina   
She's like some of the other people on this list, but straight, so she gets docked a point.
#### B Tier

### Styx  
Some great stuff absolutely ruined by them replacing their frontman and releasing pure garbage.
#### C Tier

### Rise Against  
I feel like when I saw them live their guitarist did that one run up and kick in the air move like 50 times.
#### D Tier

### Seether  
100% recommended solely because of the Veruca Salt song???
#### ? Tier

### All American Rejects  
They have a few good bops. Mostly Swing Swing.
#### B Tier

### Ed Sheeran  
I don't know how this person is different from those people in One Direction, or Matt Daemon.
#### D Tier?

### Avenge Sevenfold  
I don't know who this is.
#### D Tier

### Simple Plan  
They're just kids.
#### A Tier

### Evanescence  
Pretty sure I only know the one song, but still goated.
#### A Tier

### Avril Lavigne  
I have a saved playlist called `goals` that is mostly her.
#### S Tier

### Yellowcard  
I think this is a bad thing in soccer?
#### C Tier

### System of a Down  
Pretty solid but not what I'm in to.
#### D Tier

### Blink182
Complicated, so I'll just put them with the Foo Fighters in the
#### F Tier

### Nicki Minaj  
Not my cup of tea, so she can go with the bands I don't know what are.
#### ? Tier

### 3 Doors Down  
Kyrptonite is my favorite song to mix up with Savior by Rise Against.
#### C Tier

### Linkin Park  
Goated emo band
#### A Tier

### Bon Jovi  
Pretty good, but we can use some more company in the
#### F Tier

### Sleep Token  
My wife will kill me if I don't go with
#### S Tier
